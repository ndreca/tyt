# Trials

Step S12 of the [checklist](checklist.md) runs these prompts through the
voxel-modeling skill.

## Running a trial

Each trial runs in a fresh Claude Code session in `~/voxel-trials/<directory>`,
outside the repository. A session inside the repository could read the builder
and the docs in place of the skill. The directory holds the `SKILL.md` that the
installed vxl printed, as the vxl
[README](../../../../projects/utilities/vxl/README.md#models) shows, and a
`.claude/settings.json` that allows `vxl` commands and edits.

The prompt goes in as a user would write it, with no mention of the skill. The
trial then also tests whether the skill's description loads the skill. The
session runs passes until Claude calls the model done, and the person steps in
only where a user would.

Each trial adds a section below, titled with the prompt's number. The section
records the passes the trial took, the failures, the operations and report data
Claude wanted and lacked, and where the model's colors read flat.

## Prompts

The prompts climb from single props to scenes and interiors.

## Stresses

Prompts 11 to 30 each push on something the first ten leave alone:

11. Six strings across a 5 cm neck need voxels of about 5 mm. The guitar then
    runs about 200 voxels long against the skill's 16 to 64. The body takes 2D
    booleans and stays hollow under a one-voxel top
12. A twist reads only once the stem's section spans several cells. Bends or
    torus arcs make the arms, and five arms repeat off the orthographic axes
13. `--resolution world-y 32` meets the height with an unround voxel size that
    breaks `const v`. The 16-color pico-8 palette rules out `shades` and tests
    where the armor reads flat
14. Millimeter voxels sit below every example in the skill, and gear teeth take
    one cell each. Interlocked links share no cells, so a correct chain reports
    a piece per link. Gold renders olive under the review lighting
15. The dragon's anatomy has no sweep or skeleton to build on and comes from
    `smoothUnion`, `roundCone`, and `bend`. The renders judge it by silhouette
16. The cables hang in curves that no operation draws and take computed points.
    Hangers of different lengths need a loop, and sloped one-voxel cables can
    split into pieces. The bridge spans about 10:1 in square review frames
17. A part keeps the materials of its steps, so each piece needs a part per
    color. Five lathe profiles and a sculpted knight make 32 placements. White
    pieces stand on light squares
18. Lettering has no operation and comes from strokes a whole cell wide. The
    sign has to read the right way round in the front view, and several
    emissive colors have to stay distinct without bloom
19. The walkable tag shows in neither the report nor the renders, and the log
    checks the palette with `vxl vox-doc show`. Building the room from the kit
    pushes the session toward a library or an import. Separate tiles read as
    extra pieces on a correct kit
20. Parts nest three or four deep, and their offsets and pivots add up. The
    renders cannot show a joint turn, and the log checks each pivot in the voxj
    nodes against its hinge
21. Opaque fish and the castle inside solid water read `0 exposed` on a correct
    model and render dark behind the water. Bubbles float as pieces. The glass
    takes `#RRGGBBAA`
22. A helix has no operation. A twist on a stack of treads makes one but breaks
    the treads into fragments. A bend shapes the crooked roof
23. `coat` lays the snow. The smoke floats on purpose against the second-piece
    check. The library's snow and ice render nearly alike, and icicles can
    vanish against the snow
24. Solid terrain over about 200 m passes 300k voxels at 1 m and forces surface
    fill, a coarser grid, or a shell. Displaced terrain leaves dozens of
    one-voxel crumbs in the piece lines. The trees and the river have to meet a
    surface the model cannot query
25. A reused cottage part cannot turn to face the square. Copies repeat their
    patterns exactly unless each copy takes its own seed. The church stands as
    the one building that is no copy
26. One voxel size has to serve a 100 m scene with sub-meter windows. The front
    and right views hide the streets, and the report runs hundreds of lines.
    "One object" pushes `--flatten objects`
27. The prompt asks for the cutaway, which makes the dollhouse the control for
    28 to 30. One voxel size has to stretch from the house down to chair legs
28. Every review view looks from outside, and the session has to find a way to
    show the room. The books need variety across copies
29. The hull hides the bridge from every outside view. The stars float as
    hundreds of pieces and inflate the bounds. The radar screen takes sectors
    and arcs that have to read on a glowing panel
30. A curved hull built as a shell of a union can leave inner walls. The
    hammocks sag as one-cell sheets, and the cannons sit in carved ports. The
    lantern lights nothing under the review lighting
