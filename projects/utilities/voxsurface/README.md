# voxsurface

The boundary of a voxel grid: its faces meshed into quads and the occlusion
at their corners. voxsmith meshes objects through it and voxrender shades
through it. Everything stays in grid units on the grid's axes. The caller
applies the voxel size and the placement.

## The grid

Every algorithm reads its grid through `SurfaceGrid`: the bounds, the cell
at a position, whether a cell is opaque, and whether two cells are of one
material. A solid cell has a handle, the `Cell` type, and an empty cell has
none. `hides` says whether a neighbor hides the face against it. An opaque
neighbor does, and so does a neighbor of the face's material. `is_solid` and
`is_opaque_at` take a signed position and treat the outside as empty. A
`VoxObject` is a grid whose handles are its voxel ids. It reads as opaque
throughout because it has no palette to say otherwise.

```rust
let object = VoxObject::new("crate".to_owned(), TyVector3U32::new(2, 1, 1))?;

assert!(!object.is_solid([2, 0, 0]));
```

## Meshing

`mesh_grid` triangulates a grid by a `SurfaceMethod`. A solid cell at
`(x, y, z)` fills the unit cube from `(x, y, z)` to `(x + 1, y + 1, z + 1)`.
The `SurfaceMesh` carries one position and one normal per vertex, triangle
indices, and per quad the `SurfaceSpan` it covers beside the handles of the
cells under it. Every quad has four vertices of its own, so shading stays
flat, and triangles wind counter-clockwise seen from outside.

```rust
let mesh = mesh_grid(&object, SurfaceMethod::Greedy);

assert_eq!(mesh.quad_count(), 6);
```

Under `Culled` and `Greedy` a face stays where its neighbor does not hide
it: a face against empty space, an opaque face against glass, and a glass
face against another glass. The seam inside one glass goes.

`mesh_grid_keyed` adds a per-cell key and a span rule to a greedy run. A
span merges only cells that share a key and grows only while the rule
accepts it.

```rust
let keyed = mesh_grid_keyed(
    &object,
    SurfaceMethod::Greedy,
    &|voxel_id| voxel_id.to_u32(),
    &|span| (span.u1 - span.u0) * (span.v1 - span.v0) <= 4,
);
```

## Occlusion

`corner_occlusion` reads how open each corner of a span's face is, in the
order of the span's `corners`: `1` fully open. Each of the three opaque
cells beside the corner in the layer the face looks into closes a third, and
both cells along the face's edges together close it fully. A transparent
cell closes nothing. `inner_corner_occlusion` reads the same corners seen
from inside the span's cells, in their own layer. `mesh_occlusion` applies
`corner_occlusion` to every quad of a mesh, one value per vertex.

```rust
let occlusion = mesh_occlusion(&object, &mesh);

assert_eq!(occlusion.len(), mesh.positions.len());
```
