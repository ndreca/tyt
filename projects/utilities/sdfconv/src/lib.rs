//! Reads and writes SDF file formats through the sdfcore state.
//!
//! Each format's `-sdfcore` bridge crate owns its conversion. This crate
//! fronts them. A format is a marker type implementing [`Format`], one per
//! enabled format feature. [`ReadFormat`] and [`WriteFormat`] pick one at
//! runtime, and their `with` methods hand the marker to a visitor as a type.
//! [`read()`] and [`write()`] move a document's bytes through a format over the
//! caller's [`Dependencies`] as an [`SdfMain`](sdfcore::SdfMain). [`load()`]
//! and [`save()`] start and end at a path instead of the bytes. Each format
//! feature enables its bridge's `codec` feature and opens a module of its name
//! holding the marker and the format's writer options.
